# Usage
Depending how you want to run it, just navigate to the ./src directory of each of the apps, and do the following:

For Angular and React, run npm i then npm start.

For Vue, run yarn then yarn start.

# Thank you

Thank you to all of the open source contributors who build module federation projects and wrote articles, these applications were all in some way derived from a mixture of all of them and many of them extend on this skeleton that only shows headers.
